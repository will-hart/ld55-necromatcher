  ✘ enemy summon side effects @cancelled(24-04-14 17:47)
    This is a tricky one. I played around with a few idea but they didn't really work.
    Having random spawns made making levels difficult. I think for now leaning into it
    as a "puzzle match 3" works, however I think that weakens the theme a little.
  - at least 4 levels

  some basic sound effects:
    ✔ hit on place @done(24-04-14 16:30)
    ✔ ping on despawn @done(24-04-14 16:30)
    ✔ Level complete @done(24-04-14 16:58)
    ✘ rawr on enemy summon @cancelled(24-04-14 17:49)
      Cancelled as this is being abandoned as per "enemy summon side effects" above
  
  ✔ CI @done(24-04-14 17:49)
  ✔ Walls / other obstacle pieces @done(24-04-14 18:19)
    This can add some complexity
  - Campaign story messages in each level
  - Splash / menu screen
  - auto push to itch
  - LD page

  ✔ CI workflows  (untested) @done(24-04-13 12:15)
  - Come up with a name

Nice to have:
  - Chained animation targets, so we can do e.g. pop in and then out
  - Animation easing
  - particles on removal
  - actual sprites instead of shapes
  - combat results in chains of reactions / combos of pieces do different things
