Oh no! The people of Pleasant Vale seem to be outside asking some questions about your little necromancy habit. They've gathered a small army outside your castle. There seem to be a lot of torches for some reason, and they're so noisy its keeping your skellies awake! I think its best you summon a few troops and go harvest their souls. Maybe they're just out there because they want to find out what being undead is like?
